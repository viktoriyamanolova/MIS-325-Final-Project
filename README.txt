For our final project, we programmed a virtual single player Tic Tac Toe game where the user plays against a computer.
The program is run automatically by a user inputting python3 tictactoe.py into their terminal, with the first requirement being that the user inputs what letter they would like to play as: R or J. 
The program then randomly determines whether the player or the computer will go first. After this, each space on the tic tac toe board carries a number from 1-9, with the bottom row being 1-3 from the left to the right, the middle row being 4-6 and the top row being 7-9.  
If the computer goes first, a random space on the board is filled by the letter that the user did not choose. The user is prompted to input a number from 1-9 to determine where their chosen letter will go. If they choose a space that has already been filled by the computer or an unacceptable input, the program prompts them to choose another number.
The game continues until either the player or the computer gets 3 letters in a row - vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The user is then asked whether he or she would like to play again. The user can continue to play until they respond no when asked to play again. 
This game works because we imported "random" to select moves for the computer, which it makes it a fun single player game. We used our knowledge of functions, conditional logic, for loops, while loops, as well as other concepts we learned in class to ensure that the program runs smoothly and accounts for any errors accordingly. 
We also used this reference to guide us in the coding of our program: https://inventwithpython.com/chapter10.html

We hope you enjoy playing the game!
